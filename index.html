        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>A student’s educational journey is unique for each individual and so are our services. At JWCC, we
            offer bespoke educational planning that considers the holistic needs of our clients as we guide
            them through the college application process and beyond.</p>

            <p>We take a personal approach to consultancy and believe that our strongest asset is
            the personal rapport that we establish with our students. At JWCC you are never a
            statistic and our personalized academic plans are created with the individual in
            mind. We limit the number of students each counselor works with to ensure that
            we really connect with our students.</p>

            <p>Our advisory approach means that we act as mentors to nurture a proactive ethos
            and ensure that students are equipped to pursue lifelong success.
            The JWCC methodology focuses on holistic student development, helping identify
            academic and personal goals. JWCC places great importance on aftercare and we
            continue to support our clients post-acceptance and on into college.

                Thank you so much for helping, guiding and mentoring me throughout this process.
                You really helped in making it feel a lot more stress-free than one would typically

            counselor was how involved you were and how much you cared about me as an
